# Programs

## `OperatorsProgram.488`
This is a simple program which uses all of the available arithmetic, logical and comparison operators in the source language. It has no real purpose other than to declare variables and use all the operators.

## `ArraysProgram.488` (Incomplete)

## `LoopsProgram.488`
This program uses all available loop constructions and exit conditions. It creates an array of base numbers whose exponents are greater than or equal to 5^5, and then creates a minigame which leverages the loop exit conditions.

## `NonRecursiveFunctionsProgram.488`
This program creates a procedure for incrementing a counter which keeps track of iterations in a function, a function for resetting an accumulator, and an iterative factorial calculating function with a nested procedure for updating the accumulator. It then prints out the values of 4!, 6! and the number of iterations required.

## `RecursiveFunctionsProgram.488` (Incomplete)
Something about factorials.
